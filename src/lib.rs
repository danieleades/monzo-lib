//! This crate is a Monzo client in pure rust.
//!
//! It's ergonomic, strongly-typed, and asynchronous.
//!
//! The majority of the endpoints are already supported. If you need a piece of
//! functionality that is not yet implemented, please open an issue or even
//! better, a pull request.
//!
//! In order to use this client, you will first need to get an access token and/or refresh token for the Monzo API (see [the docs](https://docs.monzo.com/))
//!
//! ## Usage
//! ```no_run
//! use monzo::{Client, Result};
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<()> {
//!
//!     // You can create a simple monzo client using only an access token
//!     let quick_client = Client::quick("ACCESS_TOKEN");
//!
//!     // get a list of accounts
//!     let accounts = quick_client.accounts().await?;
//!
//!     // get the id of one of the accounts
//!     let account_id = accounts[0].id();
//!
//!     // get the balance of that account
//!     let balance = quick_client.balance(account_id).await?;
//!
//!     // If you have a refresh token and client credentials
//!     // you can create or upgrade a client which is capable
//!     // of refreshing its own access token.
//!     let mut refreshable_client = quick_client.with_refresh_tokens(
//!         "CLIENT_ID",
//!         "CLIENT_SECRET",
//!         "REFRESH_TOKEN",
//!     );
//!
//!     refreshable_client.refresh_auth().await?;
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
